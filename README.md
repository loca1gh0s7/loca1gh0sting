# loca1gh0sting
Small red-team script to mess with the blue team

This little thing works best on servers / boxes without GUI.
If you have r00t, use this two inject me (the loca1gh0st) user into passwd and hide from cat and tac.
Then to be mean to blue, we timestomp it really hard by settings systemtime to desired time and touching passwd. You might need to tweak this part a little bit.

Now, beware, every user that is added normally after this "patch" will not work.

I am not responsible for you rendering your box (or anyone elses) useless because you don't understand what this does.
